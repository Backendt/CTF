    Unknown service/protocol:
      Might be gRPC (Based on search results for the port number)
    Always sends the same 46 bytes
    Trying to trigger an error to get more informations:
      Sending a null byte: Same response
      Sending a newline: Same response
      Sending very long string: Same response
      Timing-out: "Did not receive HTTP/2 settings before handshake timeout":
        Likely to be gRPC (gRPC is build on top of HTTP/2)
